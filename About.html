            <h2>Fitness Statistics</h2>
            <p>
                Fitness statistics concerning sedentary lifestyles and associated health issues paint a concerning picture. 
                Inactivity remains a pervasive issue, with approximately 31% of adults worldwide failing to meet 
                recommended physical activity guidelines. This sedentary behavior contributes significantly to the 
                global burden of non-communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. 
                Alarmingly, over 1.9 billion adults are overweight, and around 650 million are classified as obese, 
                predisposing them to a host of health complications. Sedentary lifestyles are also linked to mental health
                 disorders, with depression and anxiety affecting millions globally. These statistics underscore the urgent 
                 need for initiatives promoting regular physical activity 
                to mitigate the prevalence of preventable health problems associated with inactivity.</p>
